# Markov Discord Bot (fake news)
A discord bot running a markov chain, or in the words of the bot "bot running a markov chain". Inspired by [MarkovBaj](https://github.com/marczeugs/MarkovBaj) FeelsOkayMan üëâ ‚ù§Ô∏è

I'll be honest, idk what a markov chain is LULW

## What is this?
A discord bot written in JavaScript that has some random commands while also running a markov chain responding to random users if they type in permitted channel.

## Can I use this?
Of course, but I have no intention of making this a universal bot (nor easy to setup for *anyone*). Take the code and host it wherever you like, don't forget to change the necessary parts of the code :^)
